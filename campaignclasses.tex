	These are special classes that build upon the existing core classes in the game. They reflect the influence that the setting has upon the character's own skills and talents. 
	There are essentially two types of Campaign Classes. Those that are tied to some regional background, and those tied to some faction. 
	Each faction provides some campaign classes, which maybe unlocked once they have joined and proved themselves within said faction. 
	Some campaign classes are also limited by what races may enter into it. 
\section{Dying Rat Minotaur} This faction campaign class is dedicated to maximising the lethality of his horns goring into someone on the charge.

\section{Abyssian Chariot Archer} 
A master of bow, spear and throwing axe. They are excellent at riding a Chariot. The class comes with a Loyal Henchmen whom fights with them. In exchange for the lack of normal henchmen, the class comes with other benefits.
