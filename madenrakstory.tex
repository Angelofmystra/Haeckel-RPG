Birds chirp and the sounds of a flute hum in the atmosphere. The party comprises of Maden Rak, Exeter and Victoria. They travel through the Violet Forest to the Town of Bodmin. 

``Do you hear that?'' 

``I smell Elf.''

On a tree sits an Elf playing a flute. He is fully donned in black and brown leather armour. Over his face is a bandana. His pointed ears stand out prominently. 

``That is...'' before being interrupted by the Elf.

``Maden Rak. Special Forces Commander of the Midgaardian Roaches. Servant of the Dark. Hunter of Elves, murderer of women and children. Twice decorated for valour on the field of battle.'' He claps.

``Caeryn, son of a whore.''

``I've long awaited our meeting. Laid plans, set traps... And now you appear in my forest of your own volition.''

``We are here to bring to justice the Kingslayer and those who aid him. You will rot in a Midgaardian jail!''

``Good luck. This is our land. You will not win here.''

``Since when did the Elves hire professional killers to do their dirty work. The Elves have fallen low.''

``King or beggar, whats the difference? One Human less.''

``Dont make a big deal of the race thing.''

``Yet race is the very reason we fight! We have pointed ears, you have rounded. We have long lives, you have short. Yet you multiply quickly, like vermin, but die just as easily.''

``This is not about race, or freedom, or vengeance. You just refuse to see the obvious truth.''

``And what is that obvious truth?''

``That you are just being used by others.''

``That was a thing of the past! We shall not be used again.''

``Enough of this piss!'' Maden Rak throws a knife at the Elf, who then dodges clumsily in surprise, regains his footage, and then runs up to higher ground using the cover of archers.
