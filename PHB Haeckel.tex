\chapter{Backgrounds}\label{backgrounds}


\section{Social Class} The social class system is deeply entrenched in the world and has a fundamental influence on the character's upbringings. The nature of what each social class represents differs from Kingdom to Kingdom. Loosely however there are categories which can be classified. This book does not intend to go into detail on how each Kingdom's social class is like.

A nice example of this point though is that in Abyssimiar the warrior class are part of the lower social classes, whereas in Midgaard the warrior class would more likely be in the middle social classes, whereas in Brouliard they are more likely to be in the Lower Upper Class.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Upper Upper Class (UUC)
    \item Middle Upper Class (MUC)
    \item Lower Upper Class (LUC)
    \item Upper Middle Class (UMC)
    \item Middle Middle Class (MMC)
    \item Lower Middle Class (LMC)
    \item Upper Lower Class (ULC)
    \item Middle Lower Class (MLC)
    \item Lower Lower Class (LLC)
\end{itemize}

\section{Family}
\paragraph{How did your parents treat you?} Good, Okay, Bad.
\paragraph{How many siblings do you have?} 1-9
\paragraph{What are your relationships with them like?} Good, Bad
\paragraph{Was you firstborn or what?} No, Yes, ...
\paragraph{What is the situation with your family?} Good, Bad, Terrible, Glorious, Damned
