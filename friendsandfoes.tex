\section{Factions}\label{factions}

In some Haeckel RPG campaigns a key aspect of play and the plot are the myriad of factions that exist in the world. The following provides you an entire of the kinds of factions that exist in the world.

    \subsection{The Enkertons} The Enkertons is officially the largest private law enforcement organisation in Haeckel. They provide private security services of all kinds, as well as spy and detective services. Many see them as essentially a mercenary company posing as lawmen. There is no census of how large their numbers are - though rumours abound that they are massive but highly dispersed.
    \subsection{The Puritans} Puritans are a cult whom seek to oppose and destroy all forms of magic and their ilk. They believe that magic has corrupted society from behind the scenes as part of various conspiracy theories. As such the Puritans are extremely capable at avoiding civilisation in all forms, with little disregard for law and order, and pursue search and destroy missions against anyone who fits their hit list criteria.
    \subsection{The Dark} The Dark are officially a monarchistic Knightly Order whose primary purposes are pursuing the national interest under the ethical guises of altruism and honour. The reality however is that they are often pursuing blood feuds against all the other factions whom have crossed their path. They have no unified philosophy. Some rumour that they have dealings with the Phex, though others say it is merely conspiracy. They are an extremely famous, or should I say infamous faction, because publicly they are to blame for the coup during the fall, and thus the great catastrophe itself. They all seek redemption for their past sins.
    \subsection{The Asylum} An ancient militia of medics and priests. Nowadays they sell their services to the highest bidder. They do not trust Rationality but rather Mysticism and Prophecy. They aim to build a unique relationship with each and every powerful person in Haeckel by using their divine powers for Earthly favours.  
    \subsection{Children of Luoyang Xi} Intellectual descendants of the famous Last Imperial Wizard. They seek to re-establish the ancient practice and put an end to the Invisible War.
    \subsection{Enclave of the Dying Rat} A war band of Slave owning Minotaurs whom want to reclaim their ancient homelands.
    \subsection{Order of the Black Thumb} An elite group of Rangers whom are committed to stopping the Phantasmal Forest, or die trying. What is not immediately obvious however is that they are the first major National Intelligence Agency.
    \subsection{The Grendel} 
    \subsection{The Phex}

\section{Important Characters}\label{importantcharacters}

% Psychology of batman villains
% Joker. Blowing up buildings, killing own henchmen. Desire to create chaos. Meaningful lives brought to a horrifing conclusion. APSD. Enemy of authority, which he has in spades. Feels no remorse. Chronic crazy episodes. Tend to use multiple names. 

% Viktor Zaz. Randomly stabs people to death. Keeps a tally of his victims. Constantly hallcuinates, seeing everything in red. Suffers from a gambling addiction. Traumatized by the death of his parents. Once attempted suicide. Cocktail of symptoms. Schizophrenia. 

% Poison Ivy. Little off kilter. Love of, and obsession with, plant life. Histrionic personality disorder - mostly in women. Overly emotional and traumatic behaviour designed to get attention. Sexual forwardness is a key symptom. Dressing provocatively. Rapid mood swings. Thinking relationships are more intimate than they really are. 

% Bane. Eidetic memory. Expert in various scientific disciplines, knows 8 different languages, and figured out batman's identity in a year. 

% Batman. A pathological need to help others. Hero Complex. Each time the joker, or any person gets caught, he throws them into Arkham - a minimum security facility and more akin to a revolving door for madmen. So the guardian in gotham does indeed manufacture the evils so that he can be the hero. 

These are the politically most powerful characters in Haeckel for whom the players may involve themselves with and seek to meet if they wish to involve themselves in the affairs of the provinces.
 
\subsection{Jarl Holgerholm V of Nes}
    \paragraph{Usual Location} Holgerholm Keep, North West Nes
    \paragraph{Common Knowledge} In the last years of his father's reign, his father had been stricken with disease and was driven insane. His health problems included a disgusting skin disease and more seriously some accurate attacks of a grave illness. His father's reign was extremely turbulent. There were many rumours that he had been struck down by the Gods because he took the throne, rather than inherited it. Which ever way you look at it, to take a throne was not legally defensible. The precise cause of his father's death was never found. 
    
   Holgerholm V's face was scarred; a legacy from the battle of Roggeg. That was arguably his true education - armed campaigning and military leadership. To solve his problems Holgerholm the V has to deliberately position himself as being greater than his tragic father and had to make the right friends. \paragraph{Adventurers}

And I will give it all to you. Im such a good boy arenâ€™t I. Are you ready? Im ready." -- Grandfather of Assassins  \end{snugshade}

\subsection{Queen Sophia of Brouliard}
    \paragraph{Usual Location} The true heart and beating soul of Brouliard is its cities. As an avid reader it is known that she spends alot of time in the Royal Palace. 
    \paragraph{Common Knowledge} Loved and feared by thousands of followers, glorious Queen Sophia is the driving force of Brouliard's Enlightenment. As an intellectual of the era, she is gutted by the horrid tragedies of the past. Her dream is to reinvent Mankind into one founded on the principles of rationality, observation and scholarly skepticism.
    
Following her heart and minds desire has led her to have made many enemies and allies both close and far. The future she has envisioned has captured the minds of the noble elite in Brouliard. One day her ideas will flow down to the people for whom she rules.  
    \paragraph{Adventurers}
    \paragraph{Allies} Legend contents that Queen Sophia caught sight of the bear-like physique of The Lion from her palace window. Their attraction was immediate, physical, and political. His commanding physique and dashing reputation seized her imagination. It was recorded by The Bard that he was reputed to be a sexual athlete endowed with exceptional genital development. In sexual terms, he epitomised the masterful male the same way the Queen Sophia personified the insatiable penis-conquering female.

The Lion was head of a family of brothers whom have wide influence in the Elite Guard. Their courtship was one of the key factors of her success. In personality they were complete opposites. He was a brute and a pig with no interest in academic matters. She was an intellectual with a keen interest in political science. After some years he ceased to provide her the necessary emotional and intellectual support to help her rule, and it became no longer necessary to have such a strong ally within the military factions as at this time her political opponents were largely killed off. In the end she chose the Golden Pheasant over him. The Lion was paid a large stipend so that he would not become her enemy in years to pass.
    \paragraph{Enemies} The Other Society are a gentlemen's club of monsters and supernaturals whom see themselves as the powers behind the Throne. Their motivations are selfish and petty - stoking their ego, lust and desire for revenge being their overriding goals. They see the Queen as getting too arrogant and wish to cut her down to size. 
    
    Queen Sophia did not inherit the throne but was infact taken in civil war against her Royal Husband. She depended upon the existing Church for political favour in order to build up her army. Upon wresting control from her Husband she decided that the Church were part of the problem. Public support for her actions was gained because the Church owned huge tracts of untaxed land. Playing on popular sentiment she proceeded to dismantle their power base and revoke their ownership of the Church Properties. In effect, she made Brouliard a secular state.
    
    The disenfranchised nobility whom had supported her late Husband plot behind her back. Being a Merciful Queen she spared their lives but is aware of the complication they may pose in the future. The opponent with the greatest claim to the Throne is Louis de Lione; unfortunately his fate is seemingly sealed as he is locked away in the Crimson Tower.
\begin{framed}\centeringFrom a machiavellian perspective, Queen Sophia is to be the Virtuous Tyrant. She uses this position of propaganda and idealism to take and hold onto her power base. Her narrative deals with how she handles the key weakness of this strategy; that she must morally justify her needed actions to gain advantage over her competitors to the public (either commoner or nobility). This weakness, as any Tyrant would agree, can be crippling.\end{framed}
