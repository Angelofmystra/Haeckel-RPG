\paragraph{Introduction}
The purpose of this PDF is to provide an archive of Characters that can be used by GMs in their campaigns. Each will begin with a detailed description of the character's appearance. Then it will continue with a description of the character's backstory influence and motivation. And finally it will detail some of the characteristics of the character. The characteristic of Sphere is unique to Haeckel. It provides a way of describing the theme of the character, and is therefore very important.

\section{Trauerfall the Spectre}
	A behemoth is before you, dull blackened flesh is stretched tightly over his grotesquely knotted muscles. His massive skull looms over his body, flowing with thick blackish red hair bound behind his head by what would appear to be a de-gloved hand of a small slight creature, the fingers tied into a simple knot. A rough boney brow nearly hangs over his eye sockets, prominent eyebrows of thick coarse dark auburn hair further obscure his piercing red eyes. A look of constant displeasure is etched into his weathered face. Thick lips are chapped to the point of splitting, they weep with some unsightly fluid. His blackened teeth have been filed to jagged points, looking just as painful to himself as to any who he might decide to bite. Enormous fists of blackened flesh are heavily calloused, he would appear to be no stranger to physical labor. Thick tree trunk like legs provide a  base for this beast that would appear to only move when he so desires. As you draw closer the acrid sent of rotting flesh and brimstone invades your nostrils.

\section{Cwealm the Plunderer, Scion of Ma'asei}
	Burns with the need for power. Having recognized the limits mortality placed upon him in his early years, he made it his life's work to escape them. He became a great and much feared Necromancer plundering every Wizard's Tower and ancient temple he could find in his search for dark truths. He was a rising star until jealous and ambitious rivals began to usurp his power. United, they proved stronger than the great necromancer and eventually his foes drove him to his knees. During the conflict his mind and body was wracked. Using an Invocation of widespread confusion he managed to scatter his enemies allowing him to escape. For many years after he wandered the world as a half-sane beggar. The winds of fate changed and dealt with a new hand and upon a lone mountain in Abyssimiar he found a tomb dedicated to Ma'asei â€“ the Chariot of the Gods..

\section{Abholzung the Bringer of Famine, Terror of Feykind}
	Before you towers a dark mountain of muscle and steel. Bright orange hairs are visible in all the joints of his armor. Not an inch of skin is visible on his body, except his face, which is covered with scars. His nose looks to have been broken a number of times. His calm, unblinking eyes are nearly black, and bloodshot. Demonic horns decorate his half helm, and his arm plates have large iron spikes at the elbows. His black breastplate is covered with various runes. A hammer and longsword hang from his heavy weapon belt. His long black cape seems to shroud him in darkness, even when it flaps in the wind. The double bladed battle axe he wields has black flames that seem to absorb light licking its blades. His heavy boots crush the gravel beneath his feet, but he seems not to even notice their weight. He appears to oblivious to his surroundings, but moves with the confidence of one accustomed to the field of battle.
	Throughout his military career he has dedicated his like to destroying those who defend nature. In particular Elves, Druids, and Faeries, all know him by name and seek vengeance for the terrible crimes he has committed against their peoples. Abholzung learned early in his life that drinking the blood of the Feykinds is the most satisfying experience he enjoys in this world.

\section{Bragol Amarth the Sudden Doom}
	Nothing can be discerned from the figure standing before you. The build of this form stands at approximately six feet in height with a girth that would be best guessed as elven or human. Dark black cloaks and robes cover every inch of skin that may give away his appearance, only his outline can be seen. As you stare deeper into the darkness of his hood, aqua eyes reflect out from behind the darkness piercing your gaze with a look of curiosity. In a fluid motion faster than and as silent as any drow the figures weapon can be seen as the metal reflects off the light. The figure lowers his hood and the real appearance of this man can be seen. His dark brown hair falls down to his shoulders, his aqua eyes still staring at you unwaveringly. His beard only an inch or two long is well kept for one that seems to travel many roads, money does not seem to be something this man, with little dust or dirt upon him, lacks.
	Early on in his life he came to the conclusion that the parasitic menace of Humanity is a scourge. Delving into the deepest Elven ruins he discovered a history of the Elves that revealed to him dark truths about the terrors Humanity had inflicted on his people. As the years went by his resentment and desire to see the world order get smashed grew. Despite his inner feelings he lived a peaceful life and even managed a normal family life. Like a kindling flame this turned ablaze when sparked by the catalyst of bloody tragedy. His family were destroyed before his eyes by the authorities whom jealously coveted his hard earned wealth. His current desire is to rob the governments of their treasuries in order to crash their economies.  To this end he has dedicated his life to achieving the capability to do so.

\section{Zyprexa, Seer of the Eternal Night}
	Tall and slender, this feminine Drowess holds herself in a stance of majesty. Near pitch-black skin is just tinged with a navy blue sheen. A light cape of black and red silk cover slender limbs. A red lacquer runs down thin fingers and covers long fingernails. Black cloth is wrapped around her delicate feet and wraps up to around her knees. Yellow eyes reflect what little light they take in. On her cheek branded is a luminescent black widow spider. Long pointed ears are lined from tip to base with golden hoops. A sneer is highlighted by a line of pointed teeth. A book hangs from a gold chain at her wrist , that has three interlocking rings seared into the cover. Tresses of silver hair frame her face while the rest cascades off her shoulders.

\section{Del Ampa the Hooked Horror}
	His entire outfit is composed of dull black feathers that cover him from head to toe. He tops out at barely five and a half feet in height with a frail body. His lightly feathered limbs are sinewy as well as scrawny and the visible flesh beneath the feathers is a continuous grey. His face is covered in fine but densely packed grey hair. His shadowed eyes are a piercing blue and over his face is a bird mask; its beak, which bears a scar on its' left side, is short and hooked. His head is otherwise unremarkable with slight indents in the hair betraying his ears. His cloak is similarly formed like that of folded wings with the tips of them rising behind his head. His bird wing cloak is his most impressive feature as they are overly large for his body and covered in thick royal red feathering. The bird he took this from must have been terribly large indeed. His lean torso is unremarkable; from behind his thin waist is a belt extending long red tail feathers. The lack of grime on his person from his sharp claws gloves to his wingtips accentuates his vain persona.

\section{Rock the }
In a small minuscule manner an ebony coloured figure lowers his hood and the real appearance of a dark priest can be seen. His hair, a jet black is greasy and matted about his right shoulder mostly tucked within the confines of his robes. A pair of almost translucent grey eyes seems to absorb the surrounding light burning with an unholy fervour fettered only by the deep sockets that contain them. Though his movements are nervously quick and unpredictable as he twitches you notice the tattered coverings of this rest of his body. Dented and stained with the putrid remains of blood and flesh he is covered in a plated mail and about both wrists a pair of matching etched gauntlets encase his hands. Oddly enough his weapon is firmly griped within his left hand resting upon its blade the hilt tightly clenched.

\section{The Fist of Darkness, Dread Lord}
	Greasy raven coloured hair is pulled back into a thick braid that runs down his back and ends in a silver clasp. His thick black beard is trimmed down to about four inches long. His dark blue eyes shift about quickly taking in the surroundings, checking, confirming, and repeating. The armour fits snugly about his body and seems old and well traveled. The armour is covered in a thin lay of dirt, yet makes no noise as he shifts about. Various tattoos run up his forearms, each one a symbol of death, despair, and destruction. His hand clenches involuntarily around his weapon. One must always be prepared to kill or be killed.
	This Duergar is widely hated by many people and for all the crap he gets, he basically fights solo against foes who outnumber him. One of the most common gibes against him is that he is only the Dread Lord because nobody ever gets powerful enough to match him â€“ since he slays contenders early. During his time in power he donated over 15 million to the Imperial treasury of Ablon and his favourite weapon was a flawless two-headed pickaxe named 'Inevitable'. He is a state enemy of Midgaard and the Church of Junon (the Holy Mother Church).

\section{The Taskmaster and Impudent Terror}
	Although the giant before you is somewhat small for his breed, this nine foot specimen is still mammoth by human standards. Obsidian and ebony skin glistens, stretched tightly over compactly corded muscle. Tangles of matted orange-red hair fall about the massive shoulders, which in turn tapir down the bicep before once again bulging around the great forearms. A prognathous jaw juts defiantly out in what can only be described as a gesture of stupid obstinance. Above, the thick forehead slopes down to a great bellow-nose, ringed by deeply-sunken rotator sockets. Within, baleful lavender eyes scan the area with an intelligence that is rare in this breed of warrior giants.  An almost frenetic energy surrounds this giant, as though he is simply waiting for an opportunity to lash out in a wanton act of destruction. The eyes tell a different story...
	Throughout his military career it is said by Bards that he has slain more Paladins than any fire giant before him. He prides himself on almost artful combat, fighting solely to win in any way possible rather than for honour or glory. The Maw, his favoured weapon, a demonic claw on an obsidian staff, has aided his understanding of reading others, and well placed taunts, demoralizing attacks, and strategic withdrawals prove far more effective than full frontal attacks could ever be. Cowardice and cunning are more closely connected than he once thought in his youth.

\section{Imperator of the Damned} 
The disgusting smell of embalming fluid and rotted flesh brings your gaze upon this figure. Reeking of a rotten tomb the figure standing before you seems to be human in origin, but not anymore. Tattered bandages stained with
old blood and infectious bodily fluids cover this creature's body, draping from his limbs carelessly. The portions of his body not completely covered reveal remains of embalmed leathery flesh, rotted in some places and exposing bone in others, Hollow empty eye socks with nothing but a faint reddish glow emitting from them are all that are left of this creatures eyes. Yellow and green crooked teeth emit from a strip of leathery flesh that were once lips. His movement is commanding and menacing, and an almost soundless moan continuously emits through the hole in his bandaged neck where his throat once was.
